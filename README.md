# TrustLens API - Article Analysis and Claim Extraction

## Overview

**TrustLens** is an API that analyzes news articles from a given URL and extracts:

* **Average Sentiment Analysis** on key entities (e.g., "Russia", "Zelensky", "Ukraine")
* **Claim Sentences** made in the article
* **Fact-Check Score and Evidence** for each claim using Google Custom Search API

This helps build the foundation for a fully automated **Fact-Checking System**.

---

## Current Features

### 1. Sentiment Analysis

* Extracts named entities (PERSON, GPE, ORG, EVENT, etc.).
* Computes **average polarity** (positive/negative) and **subjectivity** scores for each entity.

### 2. Claim Extraction

* Identifies factual claims made in the article.
* Prioritizes claims involving named entities and strong "claim verbs" (e.g., "announce", "claim", "warn").

### 3. Fact-Checking (Evidence Collection)

* Searches the internet using **Google Custom Search API**.
* Matches the claims against external evidence snippets.
* Assigns a simple score (1 = supported, 0 = unclear) based on fuzzy matching.
* Returns related article snippets as evidence.

## Project Architecture (High Level)

* **FastAPI** backend
* **spaCy** for NLP (entity extraction, grammar analysis)
* **TextBlob** for sentiment analysis
* **FuzzyWuzzy** for fuzzy string matching
* **Google Custom Search API** for external evidence collection

---

## How to Use

1. **POST** to `/analyze`
2. Provide the **URL** of the article you want to analyze.
3. Receive back structured **sentiment analysis** and **claim verification**.

---

## Future Roadmap

* ‚úçÔ∏è Improve claim matching by semantic embeddings (e.g., SBERT)
* üìä Score claims by confidence (e.g., \[0-100] instead of 0/1)
* üõ†Ô∏è Add entity linking and canonical resolution (e.g., "Donald Trump" == "Trump")
* üõ°Ô∏è Fact-check multiple languages (extend spaCy pipelines)
